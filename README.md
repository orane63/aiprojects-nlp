## Project Description

This repository contains our model for the past Kaggle competition Quora Insincere Questions Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-insincere-questions-classification). UCLA ACM AI has provided the skeleton code for a basic bag-of-words model, but all changes beyond that in this repository have been made purely by our team.

### Running the Code on Google Colab
