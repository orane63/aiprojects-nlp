## Project Description

This repository contains our different models for the past Kaggle competition Quora Insincere Questions Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-insincere-questions-classification). UCLA ACM AI has provided the skeleton code for a basic bag-of-words model, but all changes beyond that in this repository have been made purely by our team.

## Models

TeamAutobotsBagOfWords.ipynb is a bag of words model.
TeamAutobotsGloveLSTM.ipynb uses GloVe as the word embeddings and uses an LSTM.


### Running the Code on Google Colab

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JRmrT_FSVYsozpP4P_xjOBR7rERmaRP7?usp=sharing) is the GloVe LSTM notebook, anyone with the link should have view access.

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PY6Ef_iQ2llOMRcOPTDXplq8GXbuGIsX?usp=sharing) is the GRU one-hot encoding notebook, UCLA students should have view access.

[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T8mbtBkrCvKKN2KV92_6eS7SWbVKRye8?usp=sharing) is the bag of words notebook, anyone with the link should have view access.

[Formatting edits](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dmjbifj2EqZBnZFNEtpyeTbu4l451coB?usp=sharing) is the bag of words notebook except it looks a little nicer.
